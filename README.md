# Logotherapy - The meaning-centered Psychotherapy

Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist [Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl) and it is founded upon the belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in Humans. A short introduction to this system is given in Frankl's most famous book, [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI), in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and reinforced his theories.

The notion of Logotherapy was created with the Greek word logos (“meaning” ) and focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on man’s search for such a meaning. Victor Frankl’s concept is based on the premise that the primary motivational force of an individual is to find a meaning in life. 

The following list of tenets represents basic principles of logotherapy:  
 1. Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones. 
 2. Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life. 
 3. We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.

According to logotherapy, this striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man. 
Man’s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a “secondary rationalization” of instinctual drives.This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning. 

Man’s will to meaning can also be frustrated, in which case logotherapy speaks of “existential frustration.” 
The term “existential” may be used in three ways: to refer to 
  1. Existence itself, i.e., the specifically human mode of being; 
  2. The meaning of existence; 
  3. The striving to find a concrete meaning in personal existence, that is to say, the will to meaning.

Existential frustration can also result in neuroses. For this type of neuroses, logotherapy has coined the term [“noögenic neuroses”] 
[Noögenic neuroses] have their origin not in the psychological but rather in the “noological” (from the Greek noös meaning mind) dimension of human existence. This is another logotherapeutic term which denotes anything pertaining to the specifically human dimension.

#### NOÖGENIC NEUROSES

Noögenic neuroses emerge from existential problems. Among such problems, the frustration of the will to meaning plays a large role.
Existential frustration is in itself neither pathological nor pathogenic. A man’s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. It is doctor's task, to pilot the patient through his existential crises of growth and development. Logotherapy regards its doctor's assignment to assist the patient in finding meaning in his life. Inasmuch as logotherapy makes him aware of the hidden logos of his existence, it is an analytical process. To this extent, logotherapy resembles psychoanalysis. However, in logotherapy existential realities are primal, such as the potential meaning of patient existence to be fulfilled as well as his will to meaning. 

#### NOÖ-DYNAMICS

Man’s search for meaning should arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. Such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health. There is nothing in the world, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one’s life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: _“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”_. 

Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. 

What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. What man needs is “noö-dynamics”, the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it.

There is a detrimental influence of that feeling of which so many patients complain today, namely, the feeling of the total and ultimate meaninglessness of their lives. They lack the awareness of a meaning worth living for. They are haunted by the experience of their inner emptiness, a void within themselves; they are caught in that situation called the [“existential vacuum”].

#### THE EXISTENTIAL VACUUM
The existential vacuum is a widespread phenomenon of the twentieth century. This is understandable; it may be due to a twofold loss which man has had to undergo since he became a truly human being. No instinct tells man what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do [(conformism)] or he does what other people wish him to do [(totalitarianism)].
The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, more problems to solve than distress. And these problems are growing increasingly crucial, for progressive automation will probably lead to an enormous increase in the leisure hours available to the average worker. The pity of it is that many of these will not know what to do with all their newly acquired free time. 

Let us consider, for instance, [“Sunday neurosis”], that kind of depression which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest. Not a few cases of suicide can be traced back to this existential vacuum. Such widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction are not understandable unless we recognize the [existential vacuum] underlying them. This is also true of the crises of pensioners and aging people. Moreover, there are various masks and guises under which the existential vacuum appears. Sometimes the frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated for by a will to power, including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of frustrated will to meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.

Therefore, logotherapy is indicated not only in noögenic cases, as pointed out above, but also in psychogenic cases, and sometimes even the somatogenic (pseudo-) neuroses. Let us now consider what we can do if a patient asks what the meaning of his life is.
