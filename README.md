# Logotherapy

Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl and is based on an existential analysis focusing the will to meaning, rather than power or pleasure. Logotherapy is founded upon the belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to this system is given in Frankl's most famous book, Man's Search for Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and reinforced his theories. Presently, there are a number of logotherapy institutes around the world.

The notion of Logotherapy was created with the Greek word logos ("reason"). Victor Franklâ€™s concept is based on the premise that the primary motivational force of an individual is to find a meaning in life. The following list of tenets represents basic principles of logotherapy:  
 1. Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones. 
 2. Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life. 
 3. We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.
